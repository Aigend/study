分组数据：
SQL86 返回每个订单号各有多少行数
	select order_num, count(order_num) as order_lines from OrderItems group by order_num order by order_lines
SQL87 每个供应商成本最低的产品
	select vend_id, min(prod_price) cheapest_item from Products group by vend_id order by cheapest_item
SQL88 返回订单数量总和不小于100的所有订单的订单号
	select order_num from OrderItems group by order_num having sum(quantity) >= 100 order by order_num 
SQL89 计算总和
	select order_num, sum(item_price*quantity) total_price from OrderItems group by order_num having total_price >= 1000 order by order_num
SQL90 纠错3
	SELECT order_num, COUNT(*) AS items 
	FROM OrderItems 
	GROUP BY order_num 
	HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3 
	ORDER BY items, order_num;


使用子查询
SQL91 返回购买价格为 10 美元或以上产品的顾客列表
	select distinct cust_id from Orders where order_num in (select distinct order_num from OrderItems where item_price>=10);
SQL92 确定哪些订单购买了 prod_id 为 BR01 的产品（一）
	select cust_id, order_date from Orders where order_num in (select order_num from OrderItems where prod_id="BR01")
SQL93 返回购买 prod_id 为 BR01 的产品的所有顾客的电子邮件（一
	select cust_email from Customers where cust_id in (select cust_id from Orders where order_num in (select order_num from OrderItems where prod_id="BR01"))

# 有点挑战
####SQL94 返回每个顾客不同订单的总金额
	select cust_id, (select sum(item_price*quantity) from OrderItems group by order_num having OrderItems.order_num = Orders.order_num) total_ordered from Orders order by total_ordered desc
